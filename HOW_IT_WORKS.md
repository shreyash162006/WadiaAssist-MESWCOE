## How WadiaAssist Works

1. A student asks a question.
2. The system understands what the student is asking.
3. It checks if enough information is available.
4. It decides one of the following:
   - Provide verified information
   - Ask a clarification question
   - Create a support ticket
   - Escalate to a human authority
5. The student always receives a clear response or confirmation.

The system never guesses.
If information is not verified, it escalates responsibly.
